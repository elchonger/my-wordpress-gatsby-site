With extensive background in Strength and Conditioning you couldnâ€™t be in safer, friendlier hands. The classes will have a maximum capacity of 8 participants to ensure that every member has sufficient access to coaching.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-58fhu\">What?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-9hi8f\">The class structure we will be using will be unlike most gyms. We won&#8217;t be running random spin, body pump or pilates classes. As we are a strength and conditioning gym our classes will reflect that and every class will be carefully designed to be a part of a well rounded program. All members will have access to the class content and timetable as well as being able to log their times, weights and any other data in order to be able to improve these performance metrics over time. The fundamentals to a good strength and conditioning program are consistency, variation and most importantly enjoyment. Classes will contain elements of mobility, stability, strength, endurance, speed, power and fitness (both aerobic and anaerobic).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-m17q\">When?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-clo4v\">Starting on Monday the 9th of August our classes will run along the following timetable</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-ef552\">&#8211; Monday &#8211; Friday: 6am / 7am / 6pm / 7pm</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-fh5iu\">&#8211; Saturday: 8am / 9am</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-6qrob\">&#8211; Sunday: 9am</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-a6lpl\">But remember, we are a local gym run by locals, for locals. If this timetable doesn&#8217;t work then we are more than happy to add/move classes to suit as many members as we can.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-682u0\">Where?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-6ps86\">We are based on the Canterbury RFC grounds which allows us to have an abundance of outdoor space along side our state of the art facility. What this means is that if the weather permits it then we are more than willing to incorporate the wide open spaces into any class.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-fjf87\">Why?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-d1u3\">We feel like every gym is pretty much the same now. The average person turns up and uses some machines that they don&#8217;t really know why they are using after skipping a warm up that they don&#8217;t understand why they should do it. A class structure focusing on educating members as to why you do seems obvious. A structure that encourages measurable progression by logging results is the best way to allow individuals to train in a way that athletes do (to a certain extent) and see progress over a variety of areas. We want members signing up to exercise and getting caught up in the fun of training!</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-77ubs\">We cant wait to get started and see all the new faces who are coming along for the ride!</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-5jncf\">Sam.<br><br></p>\n","title":"Classes","date":"July 30, 2021","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"CT Barbell","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='454'%20height='341'%20viewBox='0%200%20454%20341'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M0%20171v170h455V0H0v171m59-16c-2%201-2%202-2%2015%200%2019-1%2018%2014%2018%2013%200%2015-1%2015-6%200-3%200-3-2-3s-3%201-3%202c0%202-1%202-9%202H62v-25h9c9%200%2010%201%2010%203%200%201%201%202%203%202s2%200%202-3c0-6-3-7-14-7-8%200-11%200-13%202m32%200c0%203%200%203%206%203h5v30h5v-15l1-14%205-1c6%200%206%200%206-2s-1-3-14-3H91v2m59%201c0%202%200%202%209%202s9%200%2010%203v5c-1%202-1%202-10%202s-9%200-9%203c0%202%200%202%209%202%2011%200%2012%201%2012%206%200%204-3%205-12%205s-9%200-9%202c1%204%2020%204%2023%200%203-3%203-11%201-14-2-2-2-2%200-5%202-4%201-10-2-12-2-2-4-2-12-2-10%200-10%200-10%203m47-2a577%20577%200%2000-11%2035c2%200%203-3%208-15l6-14%205%2014c6%2014%208%2017%2010%2014l-6-17c-6-16-7-18-9-18l-3%201m30%201c0%203%200%203%2010%203l11%201v10h-10c-10%200-11%201-11%203s0%202%207%202h7l4%208c2%206%203%207%205%207%204%200%204-1%200-8l-2-7c4-1%205-4%205-10%200-10-2-11-16-11-10%200-10%200-10%202m41%201c0%202%200%202%208%202%209%200%2011%201%2011%205s-2%205-11%205c-8%200-8%200-8%203%200%202%200%202%209%202%2010%200%2011%201%2011%206%200%204-2%205-12%205-8%200-8%200-8%203%200%202%200%202%208%202%2010%200%2015-1%2016-4%202-3%201-11-1-13s-2-2-1-4c3-4%202-10%200-13-3-2-4-2-12-2-10%200-10%200-10%203m36%200v2h26v-5h-26v3m36%2015l1%2018h23v-3c0-2-1-3-10-3h-9v-30h-5v18m33%200v18h23v-6h-18v-30h-5v18m-69%200v2h25v-5h-25v3m12%2013h-12v5h13c11%200%2013-1%2013-2%200-3-1-4-14-3'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/my-wordpress-gatsby-site/static/01b5dec3c680084ee324099907bc6e9d/f3af3/featured-image.png","srcSet":"/my-wordpress-gatsby-site/static/01b5dec3c680084ee324099907bc6e9d/f3af3/featured-image.png 454w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/my-wordpress-gatsby-site/static/01b5dec3c680084ee324099907bc6e9d/72d38/featured-image.webp 454w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.7511013215859031}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/our-approach-to-programming/","title":"Our approach to programming!"},"next":{"uri":"/all-you-need-to-know/","title":"All you need to know"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMzM=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoxMzU=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxMzA="}},"staticQueryHashes":["104267996","1682016598","848497233"]}

We don’t want our members or clients to be lacking in any one particular aspect of physical fitness. Training for Strength or Cardiovascular fitness alone is outdated and frankly boring. Conditioning is about preparing your body for the tasks that you are going to ask it to preform. We aim to equip our members with the ability to do anything through the process of training everything!</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-86jt1\">We use basic fundamentals in our programming. Working in blocks of 8 or 12 weeks building to a testing week. We believe that programs must contain the following elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-dpfr6\">Consistency &#8211;</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-el297\">Every good program must be consistent. This includes consistency in frequency of training, load of resistance, training of energy systems and recovery. Like anything, that takes time, building a robust, functionally appropriate level of fitness requires commitment… (or consistency)</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-dpm7e\">Variation &#8211;</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-76sbt\">This may seem like a counter productive point to consistency but variation is also a key element to any good program. Our bodies learn how to adapt and better recover from the workout routine we adhere to. We must change the way in which we train in order to prevent our bodies from being able to recover quickly and thus force adaptation. A good example of consistency without variation might be for example; training our lower body consistently by using only back squats. This would not provide enough variation to force optimal adaptation. Therefore we vary our lower body training using other exercises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-tr1m\">Enjoyment &#8211;</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-f78a9\">No matter how effective the perfect training session is on paper, if it isn’t enjoyable then it won’t be sustainable. The sustainability of a program can be based on very individual factors but one way we try to make the programs we design as sustainable as possible is by encouraging all our members to buy into our community mentality. Feeling part of a gym that cares about your training and training alongside others who are invested in a culture that thrives when everyone is progressing and enjoying their training is an infectious environment and one we strive to maintain and build on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-2k4fr\">Our Group Programming &#8211;</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-9ud00\">Our classes are unlike any others. Every class is carefully designed as part of a well thought out program. Train &#8211; Track &#8211; Test are our three rules of thumb. And our group program follows these guidelines through providing members with an app to manage their progress and input their results from the class.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-6brbo\">Individual Bespoke Program &#8211;</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-ff2s\">The individual programs we design are based around prioritising the needs of the individual through a completely bespoke program. However as a lot of our individually programmed members love to take part in some of the group program classes, the individual programs run alongside a similar framework to the group programming. This allows for dipping in and out of the group program without missing out on progressing in your personal program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-d0345\">As much as we can try to talk about the benefits of our programs there really is no substitute for getting stuck in.

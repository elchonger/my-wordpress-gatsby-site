So here we go.</p>\n","content":"\n<p id=\"viewer-foo\">We have been getting a lot of questions about how CT Barbell will work. Will there be classes? What sort of gym is it? What are the opening times? etc etc&#8230; So we thought it was probable easiest to address all these questions in a blog post. So here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-8ddtt\">What type of gym will CT Barbell be?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-dmlun\">This is simple. CT Barbell is a &#8220;spit and sawdust,&#8221; &#8220;no noise&#8221; strength and conditioning gym. Our programming, equipment, approach to training is very much athlete/performance based that is applicable to the average gym goer. Strength and Conditioning is all about minimising the potential for injury while maximising the potential for performance. This can be as complex as developing a very powerful rugby tackle or loosing weight to reduce knee pain. The bottom line is we put functionality and performance ahead of looking good&#8230; and as a result training becomes a lifestyle and looking good tends to be a byproduct.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-7a5cs\">What equipment will be at CT Barbell?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-5fa18\">We will be a very free weights oriented gym. That means lots of barbells, dumbbells and Kettlebells. We will also have some cardio machines (rowers, Ski-erg&#8217;s and Bike-erg&#8217;s). Our on site Physiotherapy/Sports massage room also allow us to provide our members with a high level of treatments in that aspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-18l91\">How much will membership be?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-7tjrg\">We have kept the membership structure very simple. No Contracts, no discounts, no nonsense.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\"><li>Access to use the gym at any time during opening hours &#8211; £30</li><li>Access to the gym + Classes and a group program which the classes will run off &#8211; £70</li><li>No Access to the gym + Group program access (suitable for non-Canterbury based) &#8211; £40</li><li>Access to the gym + Classes and an individualised program &#8211; £100</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-a417a\">Prices are Per Month*</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-9cer7\">What&#8217;s different about CT Barbell?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-e3hpl\">As much as CT Barbell is a gym we are more than that. We have set ourselves some ambitious goals to create a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-ft62r\">&#8211; Quarterly get togethers for all members to socialise, the rugby club have kindly offered to open the bar for these and food will also be available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-5oa83\">&#8211; Guest speakers coming into the gym to talk about nutrition and mental health will help us to provide full access to all aspects of fitness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-7d5an\">&#8211; A huge aspect of what we are about is education, weather its a fact on the white board, our library of books on health and fitness in the gym or just some nuggets of wisdom from a coach. We want to have the most educated member base in the United Kingdom. We feel this is a win win and cant wait to try and tackle this goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-bb5o3\">&#8211; We want to get to know every single one of our members on a personal level. We are a local business and every one of our members is trusting us with their health. The least any gym can do is know where your kid goes to school or where you last went on holiday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-4vp2q\">That is pretty much it about us. There are some other little bits like, we will be selling some merchandise and supplements but I&#8217;ll save that for another blog!</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-824er\">Thanks for reading, we are really looking forward to our new gym and we hop you are too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-91duo\">Sam.<br><br></p>\n","title":"All you need to know","date":"July 14, 2021","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"CT Barbell","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='454'%20height='341'%20viewBox='0%200%20454%20341'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M0%20171v170h455V0H0v171m59-16c-2%201-2%202-2%2015%200%2019-1%2018%2014%2018%2013%200%2015-1%2015-6%200-3%200-3-2-3s-3%201-3%202c0%202-1%202-9%202H62v-25h9c9%200%2010%201%2010%203%200%201%201%202%203%202s2%200%202-3c0-6-3-7-14-7-8%200-11%200-13%202m32%200c0%203%200%203%206%203h5v30h5v-15l1-14%205-1c6%200%206%200%206-2s-1-3-14-3H91v2m59%201c0%202%200%202%209%202s9%200%2010%203v5c-1%202-1%202-10%202s-9%200-9%203c0%202%200%202%209%202%2011%200%2012%201%2012%206%200%204-3%205-12%205s-9%200-9%202c1%204%2020%204%2023%200%203-3%203-11%201-14-2-2-2-2%200-5%202-4%201-10-2-12-2-2-4-2-12-2-10%200-10%200-10%203m47-2a577%20577%200%2000-11%2035c2%200%203-3%208-15l6-14%205%2014c6%2014%208%2017%2010%2014l-6-17c-6-16-7-18-9-18l-3%201m30%201c0%203%200%203%2010%203l11%201v10h-10c-10%200-11%201-11%203s0%202%207%202h7l4%208c2%206%203%207%205%207%204%200%204-1%200-8l-2-7c4-1%205-4%205-10%200-10-2-11-16-11-10%200-10%200-10%202m41%201c0%202%200%202%208%202%209%200%2011%201%2011%205s-2%205-11%205c-8%200-8%200-8%203%200%202%200%202%209%202%2010%200%2011%201%2011%206%200%204-2%205-12%205-8%200-8%200-8%203%200%202%200%202%208%202%2010%200%2015-1%2016-4%202-3%201-11-1-13s-2-2-1-4c3-4%202-10%200-13-3-2-4-2-12-2-10%200-10%200-10%203m36%200v2h26v-5h-26v3m36%2015l1%2018h23v-3c0-2-1-3-10-3h-9v-30h-5v18m33%200v18h23v-6h-18v-30h-5v18m-69%200v2h25v-5h-25v3m12%2013h-12v5h13c11%200%2013-1%2013-2%200-3-1-4-14-3'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/my-wordpress-gatsby-site/static/01b5dec3c680084ee324099907bc6e9d/f3af3/featured-image.png","srcSet":"/my-wordpress-gatsby-site/static/01b5dec3c680084ee324099907bc6e9d/f3af3/featured-image.png 454w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/my-wordpress-gatsby-site/static/01b5dec3c680084ee324099907bc6e9d/72d38/featured-image.webp 454w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.7511013215859031}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/classes/","title":"Classes"},"next":{"uri":"/the-ct-barbell-way-our-ethos/","title":"The CT Barbell way (Our ethos)"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMzA=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoxMzM=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxMjM="}},"staticQueryHashes":["104267996","1682016598","848497233"]}

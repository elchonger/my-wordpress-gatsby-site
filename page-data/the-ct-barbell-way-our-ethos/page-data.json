Well I was one of them. The only difference is that now myself and Tristan king have only gone and done it. So I suppose the question is what exactly does &#8216;doing it better&#8217; look like for CT Barbell? Two of the most important areas are Community and Education.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-d14fa\">Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-15u3i\">At CT barbell we are very lucky to be located on the Canterbury rugby club site. Most gyms are a place to go and spend an hour of your day every so often where a tired personal trainer who is only interested in helping out if they think you might sign up as a client. Or a spin instructor who&#8217;s had too much caffeine and is doing your head in. A gym should be a place where the members and staff are all part of a community, being a member of a gym should be an integrated part of your lifestyle. Not a chore that you have to convince yourself to go through. Now this all sounds great but the real question is, how do we plan to create that environment? Well&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a cap on how many members we take in. This allows our small staff of local professionals to get to know every one of our members. I mean really get to know them. Not the &#8216;What are you training today&#8217; sort of know each other, but the &#8216;how are the kids, I saw you at the pub and the hows the new puppy&#8217; really get to know each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A barbecue (Or England weather friendly grub option) along with the opening of the rugby club bar after a fun day of challenges every few months for members and non members alike will provide opportunities to really feel part of the gym where you are not just a &#8216;member.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rule number 1 at CT Barbell is always to say hello. Members and staff. So if you come in and someone else is chasing those gains or smashing their cardio, a smile and a wave is something that we never want to be lacking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-a8ekq\">Education</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-b1c7\">Now this might not be something generally associated with gym membership but we&#8217;ve set ourselves a rather unusual goal. That goal is to have the most educated member base out of any gym in the UK. Now this doesn&#8217;t mean that Tristan is going to start throwing surprise tests on anatomy and physiology in the middle of a class. There are a few ways we plan to go about this. So let me share them with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than just telling. We as coaches will do our best to explain why we are doing what we are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guest Speakers every month will be addressing members on many areas of health and fitness. From mental health to diet and the mechanics of weightlifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A verity of books will be available for members to checkout. Ranging from planning a gym program to assessing your injuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our social media feeds aim to be saturated with helpful information for members and non members alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-1dj81\">Thanks for reading our short blog. As a new business all the help we can get is hugely appreciated so thank you for reading and please feel free to like and share.<br><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","title":"The CT Barbell way (Our ethos)","date":"June 08, 2021","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"CT Barbell","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='454'%20height='341'%20viewBox='0%200%20454%20341'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M0%20171v170h455V0H0v171m59-16c-2%201-2%202-2%2015%200%2019-1%2018%2014%2018%2013%200%2015-1%2015-6%200-3%200-3-2-3s-3%201-3%202c0%202-1%202-9%202H62v-25h9c9%200%2010%201%2010%203%200%201%201%202%203%202s2%200%202-3c0-6-3-7-14-7-8%200-11%200-13%202m32%200c0%203%200%203%206%203h5v30h5v-15l1-14%205-1c6%200%206%200%206-2s-1-3-14-3H91v2m59%201c0%202%200%202%209%202s9%200%2010%203v5c-1%202-1%202-10%202s-9%200-9%203c0%202%200%202%209%202%2011%200%2012%201%2012%206%200%204-3%205-12%205s-9%200-9%202c1%204%2020%204%2023%200%203-3%203-11%201-14-2-2-2-2%200-5%202-4%201-10-2-12-2-2-4-2-12-2-10%200-10%200-10%203m47-2a577%20577%200%2000-11%2035c2%200%203-3%208-15l6-14%205%2014c6%2014%208%2017%2010%2014l-6-17c-6-16-7-18-9-18l-3%201m30%201c0%203%200%203%2010%203l11%201v10h-10c-10%200-11%201-11%203s0%202%207%202h7l4%208c2%206%203%207%205%207%204%200%204-1%200-8l-2-7c4-1%205-4%205-10%200-10-2-11-16-11-10%200-10%200-10%202m41%201c0%202%200%202%208%202%209%200%2011%201%2011%205s-2%205-11%205c-8%200-8%200-8%203%200%202%200%202%209%202%2010%200%2011%201%2011%206%200%204-2%205-12%205-8%200-8%200-8%203%200%202%200%202%208%202%2010%200%2015-1%2016-4%202-3%201-11-1-13s-2-2-1-4c3-4%202-10%200-13-3-2-4-2-12-2-10%200-10%200-10%203m36%200v2h26v-5h-26v3m36%2015l1%2018h23v-3c0-2-1-3-10-3h-9v-30h-5v18m33%200v18h23v-6h-18v-30h-5v18m-69%200v2h25v-5h-25v3m12%2013h-12v5h13c11%200%2013-1%2013-2%200-3-1-4-14-3'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/my-wordpress-gatsby-site/static/01b5dec3c680084ee324099907bc6e9d/f3af3/featured-image.png","srcSet":"/my-wordpress-gatsby-site/static/01b5dec3c680084ee324099907bc6e9d/f3af3/featured-image.png 454w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/my-wordpress-gatsby-site/static/01b5dec3c680084ee324099907bc6e9d/72d38/featured-image.webp 454w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.7511013215859031}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/all-you-need-to-know/","title":"All you need to know"},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMjM=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoxMzA=","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["104267996","1682016598","848497233"]}

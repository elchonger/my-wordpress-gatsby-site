I have always had a keen interest in sport and maintaining physical fitness to prevent injury. Top performance can’t all be about training, the real success comes from looking at the whole picture, knowing the balance between strengthening and stretching, training and recovering. I believe sports massage has a key role to play in keeping every individual, regardless of their chosen discipline, in peak fitness. The key is to remain injury free or at the very least recover from injury quickly. Long term we all need to ensure we can remain well and mobile as we get older.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"viewer-2534h\">My Background in Health and Fitness</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-8c4q8\">I am a keen swimmer and find a lot of enjoyment sea swimming, even in the depths of winter! In July this year I was part of a 4 person relay team who successfully swam then English Channel in 16hrs 45mins. My other sporting passion is my horses, I have ridden from a very young age and despite countless falls and injuries still love the adrenaline rush it gives me. I have a young horse who I am currently training and plan to be out competing in British Eventing next season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-bfecq\">I enjoy working with anyone looking to improve their range of movement, alleviate stiffness and ultimately improve their performance and ongoing comfort. I have worked with triathletes, swimmers, horse riders, footballers, rugby players and numerous people with physical jobs needing assistance. I am always happy to talk through your needs and look forward to getting started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-8b58c\">Ros.<br><br></p>\n","title":"Rosalind South : Sports Massage Therapist","date":"September 03, 2021","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"CT Barbell","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='454'%20height='341'%20viewBox='0%200%20454%20341'%20preserveAspectRatio='none'%3e%3cpath%20d='M0%20171v170h455V0H0v171m59-16c-2%201-2%202-2%2015%200%2019-1%2018%2014%2018%2013%200%2015-1%2015-6%200-3%200-3-2-3s-3%201-3%202c0%202-1%202-9%202H62v-25h9c9%200%2010%201%2010%203%200%201%201%202%203%202s2%200%202-3c0-6-3-7-14-7-8%200-11%200-13%202m32%200c0%203%200%203%206%203h5v30h5v-15l1-14%205-1c6%200%206%200%206-2s-1-3-14-3H91v2m59%201c0%202%200%202%209%202s9%200%2010%203v5c-1%202-1%202-10%202s-9%200-9%203c0%202%200%202%209%202%2011%200%2012%201%2012%206%200%204-3%205-12%205s-9%200-9%202c1%204%2020%204%2023%200%203-3%203-11%201-14-2-2-2-2%200-5%202-4%201-10-2-12-2-2-4-2-12-2-10%200-10%200-10%203m47-2a577%20577%200%2000-11%2035c2%200%203-3%208-15l6-14%205%2014c6%2014%208%2017%2010%2014l-6-17c-6-16-7-18-9-18l-3%201m30%201c0%203%200%203%2010%203l11%201v10h-10c-10%200-11%201-11%203s0%202%207%202h7l4%208c2%206%203%207%205%207%204%200%204-1%200-8l-2-7c4-1%205-4%205-10%200-10-2-11-16-11-10%200-10%200-10%202m41%201c0%202%200%202%208%202%209%200%2011%201%2011%205s-2%205-11%205c-8%200-8%200-8%203%200%202%200%202%209%202%2010%200%2011%201%2011%206%200%204-2%205-12%205-8%200-8%200-8%203%200%202%200%202%208%202%2010%200%2015-1%2016-4%202-3%201-11-1-13s-2-2-1-4c3-4%202-10%200-13-3-2-4-2-12-2-10%200-10%200-10%203m36%200v2h26v-5h-26v3m36%2015l1%2018h23v-3c0-2-1-3-10-3h-9v-30h-5v18m33%200v18h23v-6h-18v-30h-5v18m-69%200v2h25v-5h-25v3m12%2013h-12v5h13c11%200%2013-1%2013-2%200-3-1-4-14-3'%20fill='%23d3d3d3'%20fill-rule='evenodd'/%3e%3c/svg%3e"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/my-wordpress-gatsby-site/static/01b5dec3c680084ee324099907bc6e9d/f3af3/featured-image.png","srcSet":"/my-wordpress-gatsby-site/static/01b5dec3c680084ee324099907bc6e9d/f3af3/featured-image.png 454w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/my-wordpress-gatsby-site/static/01b5dec3c680084ee324099907bc6e9d/72d38/featured-image.webp 454w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.7511013215859031}}}}}},"previous":{"uri":"/the-warm-up-our-approach/","title":"The Warm Up : Our approach Yo"},"next":{"uri":"/active-v-passive-recovery/","title":"Active v Passive Recovery"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxNDA=","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoxNDM=","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxMzc="}},"staticQueryHashes":["104267996","1682016598","848497233"]}
